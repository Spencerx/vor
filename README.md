# [Vör](http://vor.space)

To purify your place of work, sprinkle water and say: *"By Vör be cleansed, darkness return, to darkness below"  [*](http://www.northernpaganism.org/shrines/handmaidens/vor/who-is.html)*

[Vör](http://vor.space) is open source software and hardware for turning your open office into an open, realtime map for finding people, open work places and current events. Open. Really. :)

This project is currently migrating from other repos and undergoing active development. Expect cool, but don't expect stability.
