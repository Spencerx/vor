# 3D Models

## IoT 3D Component Models
[3D IoT Component Models](/3d-models/3d-iot-component-models/README.md) of thinks like a Raspberry Pi to help in planning your custom case designs

## IoT 3D Case Models
[3D IoT Case Models](/3d-models/3d-iot-case-models/README.md)  of thinks like a bathroom sensor array and Arduino Yun Mini to help in planning your custom case designs

## Other Models
These models may be the basis for 3D Cases and other printables

* cadcorn.scad - [3D View](/3d-models/chilicorn-hipoly.stl) A parametric unicorn CAD model for use as a Raspberry Pi case etc. Change parameters to switch horn types, set polygon count, tilt the head, fatten the legs, add a base to hold the part and such. The chili horn is a joke for [chilicorn.org](http://chilicorn.org)
