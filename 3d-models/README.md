## IoT 3D Component Models
(3D IoT Component Models)[3d-iot-component-models/README.md] of thinks like a Raspberry Pi to help in planning your custom case designs

## IoT 3D Case Models
(3D IoT Case Models)[3d-iot-case-models/README.md]  of thinks like a bathroom sensor array and Arduino Yun Mini to help in planning your custom case designs

## Other Models
These models may be the basis for 3D Cases and other printables

* cadcorn.scad - A low-poly unicorn as a Raspberry Pi case. Change parameters to switch horn types, set polygon count,
tilt the head, fatten the legs, add a base to hold the part etc. The chili horn is a joke, see (chilicorn.org)[http://chilicorn.org]
