# 3D Internet of Things (IoT) Models of Components

These may be used in planning and combining assemblies. Please add parts you use so that others may benefit.

Most models are negative space, not representational. They are included in IoT case models as negative space subtracted from the inside of a solid object such that the actual component can be inserted and used. To minimize finishing work, extra space is included in some dimensions of models. A minkowski transform of the component model with a small sphere or cube may also be useful to provide additional skin space around the component. This skin parameter, external to the component models below, can be tuned in the case model based on the 3D printer precision and other characteristics.
