## Build Instructions
1. 3D print the left and right half shells for the case
1. Solder and/or wire-wrap switch, sensor, actuator and Yun Mini wires as appropriate
1. Place appropriate switches, sensors, actuators and Yun Mini and combine the two case sides 
1. Attach the left and right sides with two M3 bolts, nuts and washers

More detailed build instructions on each sensor are available in [Vör Arduino](/vor-arduino/README.md)
